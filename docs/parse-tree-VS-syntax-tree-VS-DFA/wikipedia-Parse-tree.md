# [Parse tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree)

A **parse tree** or **parsing tree**[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree#cite_note-1) or **derivation tree** or **concrete syntax tree** is an ordered, rooted [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)) that represents the [syntactic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax) structure of a [string](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) according to some [context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar). The term *parse tree* itself is used primarily in [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics); in theoretical syntax, the term *syntax tree* is more common.

Parse trees concretely[*[clarification needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Please_clarify)*] reflect the **syntax** of the input language, making them distinct from the [abstract syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) used in computer programming. Unlike Reed-Kellogg [sentence diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_diagram) used for teaching grammar, **parse trees** do not use distinct symbol shapes for different types of [constituents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constituent_(linguistics))（成分）.

Parse trees are usually constructed based on either the constituency relation of constituency grammars ([phrase structure grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar)) or the dependency relation of [dependency grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar). Parse trees may be generated for [sentences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(linguistics)) in [natural languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) (see [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)), as well as during [processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) of computer languages, such as [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language).[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*]

A related concept is that of **phrase marker** or **P-marker**, as used in [transformational generative grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_generative_grammar). A phrase marker is a linguistic expression marked as to its phrase structure. This may be presented in the form of a tree, or as a bracketed expression. Phrase markers are generated by applying [phrase structure rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_rules), and themselves are subject to further transformational rules.[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree#cite_note-Chomsky2014-2) A set of possible parse trees for a [syntactically ambiguous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_ambiguity) sentence is called a "parse forest."[[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree#cite_note-3)
