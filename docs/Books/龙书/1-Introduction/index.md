# Chapter 1 Introduction

How long have you been programming? Have you ever wondered what a programming language is? 

There are many ways to answer this question, here I will try to answer this question from some different perspectives.

## From  [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language)

A **programming language** is a [formal language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language),  so it is equipped with

2縲ーwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)) and [lexical grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_grammar) to defining the [syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) of [tokens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_(parser)).

## From the perspectives of a compiler 

How dose compiler understand what the program mean? The table is a summary of the implementation of compiler.

[Lexical grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_grammar), [syntax ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) and [semantics ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) define a programming language,.Only when specifying [lexical grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_grammar), [syntax ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) and [semantics ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)) can the **compiler** understand what programmer have written and translate the language correctly. 



This book is about how to design and implement compilers. We shall discover that a few basic ideas can be used to construct translators for a wide variety of languages and machines. Besides compilers, the **principles** and **techniques** for compiler design are applicable to so many other domains that they are likely to be reused many times in the career of a computer scientist. The study of compiler writing touches up on programming languages, machine architecture, language theory, algorithms, and software engineering.
