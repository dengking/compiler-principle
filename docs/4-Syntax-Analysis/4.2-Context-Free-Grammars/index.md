# 4.2 Context-Free Grammars



## 4.2.3 Derivations

> NOTE: Derivation means 推导 in Chinese.

The construction of a parse tree can be made precise by taking a derivational view, in which productions are treated as rewriting rules. Beginning with the start symbol, each rewriting step replaces a **nonterminal** by the body of one of its productions. This derivational view corresponds to the **top-down** construction
of a **parse tree**, but the precision afforded by **derivations** will be especially helpful when **bottom-up** parsing is discussed. As we shall see, **bottom-up parsing** is related to a class of derivations known as "**rightmost**" derivations, in which the **rightmost nonterminal** is rewritten at each step.

If $S \xrightarrow []{ \ast} \alpha$ where $S$ is the start symbol of a grammar $G$, we say that $\alpha$ is a *sentential form* of G. Note that a **sentential form** may contain both **terminals** and **nonterminals**, and may be empty. A *sentence* of G is a **sentential form** with no **nonterminals**. The *language* generated by a grammar is its set of **sentences**.
Thus, a string of terminals $w$ is in $L(G)$, the language generated by G, if and only if $w$ is a sentence of G (or $S \xrightarrow []{ \ast} w $. A language that can be generated by a **grammar** is said to be a **context-free language**. If two grammars generate the same language, the grammars are said to be *equivalent*.

> NOTE: Natural language is not **context-free language**.



To understand how parsers work, we shall consider derivations in which the **nonterminal** to be replaced at each step is chosen as follows:

1、In *leftmost derivations*, the **leftmost nonterminal** in each sentential is always chosen. If $\alpha \to \beta $ is a step in which the leftmost nonterminal in $\alpha$ is replaced, we write $\alpha \xrightarrow [ \text{lm} ]{} \beta$ .

2、In *rightmost derivations*, the **rightmost nonterminal** is always chosen; we write $\alpha \xrightarrow [ \text{rm} ]{} \beta$   in this case.



If  , then we say that  is a *left-sentential form* of the grammar at hand.

Analogous definitions hold for **rightmost derivations**. Rightmost derivations are sometimes called *canonical derivations*.

## 4.2.4 Parse Trees and Derivations

A parse tree is a graphical representation of a derivation that filters out the **order** in which productions are applied to replace nonterminals. Each interior node of a parse tree represents the application of a production. The interior node is labeled with the nonterminal `A` in the head of the production; the children of the node are labeled, from left to right, by the symbols in the body of the production by which this `A` was replaced during the derivation.

> NOTE: Left-most derivation and right-most derivation yield the same tree in the end but the order in which productions are applied to replace nonterminals is different.

> > [Regular languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_language) are a category of languages (sometimes termed [Chomsky Type 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky_hierarchy)) which can be matched by a state machine (more specifically, by a [deterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton) or a [nondeterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton)) constructed from a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). In particular, a regular language can match constructs like "A follows B", "Either A or B", "A, followed by zero or more instances of B", but cannot match constructs which require consistency between non-adjacent elements, such as "some instances of A followed by the same number of instances of B", and also cannot express the concept of recursive "nesting" ("every A is eventually followed by a matching B"). A classic example of a problem which a regular grammar cannot handle is the question of whether a given string contains correctly-nested parentheses. (This is typically handled by a Chomsky Type 2 grammar, also termed a [context-free grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar).)

> Every **regular language** is **context-free**, every **context-free** language is **context-sensitive**, every **context-sensitive language** is **recursive** and every **recursive language** is recursively enumerable. These are all proper inclusions, meaning that there exist recursively enumerable languages that are not context-sensitive, context-sensitive languages that are not context-free and context-free languages that are not regular.
