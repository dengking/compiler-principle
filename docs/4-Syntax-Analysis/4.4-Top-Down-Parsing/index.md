# 4.4 Top-Down Parsing

Top-down parsing can be viewed as the problem of constructing a parse tree for the input string, starting from the root and creating the nodes of the parse tree in preorder (depth-first, as discussed in Section 2.3.4). Equivalently, **top-down parsing** can be viewed as finding a **leftmost derivation** for an input string.
