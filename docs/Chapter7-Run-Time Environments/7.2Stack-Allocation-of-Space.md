# 7.2 Stack Allocation of Space

Almost all compilers for languages that use procedures, functions, or methods as units of user-defined actions manage at least part of their run-time memory as a **stack**. Each time a **procedure** is called, space for its local variables is pushed onto a **stack**, and when the procedure terminates, that space is popped
off the stack. As we shall see, this arrangement not only allows space to be shared by procedure calls whose durations do not overlap in time, but it allows us to compile code for a procedure in such a way that the **relative addresses** of its **nonlocal variables** are always the same, regardless of the sequence of procedure calls.

## 7.2.1 Activation Trees

Stack allocation would not be feasible(可行的) if procedure calls, or activations of procedures, did not nest in time. The following example illustrates nesting of procedure calls.

**Example 7.1** : Figure 7.2 contains a sketch of a program that reads nine integers into an array `a` and sorts them using the recursive **quicksort algorithm**.

```c
int a[11];
void readArray() { /* Reads 9 integers into a[1]; :::; a[9]. */
    int i;
    ...
}
int partition(int m, int n) {
/* Picks a separator value v , and partitions a[m .. n] so that
a[m , p - 1] are less than v , a[p] = v , and a[p + 1 , n] are
equal to or greater than v . Returns p. */
	...
}
void quicksort(int m, int n) {
    int i;
    if (n > m) {
	    i = partition(m, n);
    	quicksort(m, i-1);
    	quicksort(i+1, n);
	}
}
main() {
    readArray();
    a[0] = -9999;
    a[10] = 9999;
    quicksort(1,9);
}
```







The main function has three tasks. It calls `readArray`, sets the sentinels, and then calls `quicksort` on the entire data array. Figure 7.3 suggests a sequence of calls that might result from an execution of the program. In this execution, the call to `partition (1, 9)` returns 4, so `a[1]`through `a[3]` hold elements less than its chosen separator value `v` , while the larger elements are in `a[5]` through `a[9]`.
