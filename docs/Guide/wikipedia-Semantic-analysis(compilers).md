# [Semantic analysis (compilers)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_analysis_(compilers))

**Semantic analysis** or **context sensitive analysis** is a process in [compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) construction, usually after [parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing), to gather necessary semantic information from the [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code).[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_analysis_(compilers)#cite_note-WilhelmSeidl2013-1) It usually includes [type checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_checking), or makes sure a variable is declared before use which is impossible to describe in the [extended Backus–Naur form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus–Naur_form) and thus not easily detected during parsing.
