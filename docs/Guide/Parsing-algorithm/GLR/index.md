# GLR parser



素材:

一、stackoverflow [Are GCC and Clang parsers really handwritten?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6319086/are-gcc-and-clang-parsers-really-handwritten) # [A](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6320330) 

> What is true, is that C and C++ are relatively easy to parse with stronger automatically generated parsers, e.g., [GLR parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLR_parser), and you don't need any hacks. The [Elsa](http://www.scottmcpeak.com/elkhound/) C++ parser is one example of this. Our [C++ Front End](http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/FrontEnds/CppFrontEnd.html) is another (as are all our "compiler" front ends, GLR is pretty wonderful parsing technology).
