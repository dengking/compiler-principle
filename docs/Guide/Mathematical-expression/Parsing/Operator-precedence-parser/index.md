# Operator-precedence parser



## wikipedia [Operator-precedence parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_parser)

In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), an **operator precedence parser** is a [bottom-up parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottom-up_parsing) that interprets an [operator-precedence grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator-precedence_grammar). For example, most [calculators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculator) use operator precedence parsers to convert from the human-readable [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) relying on [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations) to a format that is optimized for evaluation such as [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) (RPN).

[Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_Dijkstra)'s [shunting yard algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) is commonly used to implement operator precedence parsers. Other algorithms include the precedence climbing method and the [top down operator precedence method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_parser).
