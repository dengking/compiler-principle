**Infix notation** is the notation commonly used in [arithmetical](https://infogalactic.com/info/Arithmetic) and [logical](https://infogalactic.com/info/Logic) formulae and statements. It is characterized by the placement of [operators](https://infogalactic.com/info/Operator_(mathematics)) between [operands](https://infogalactic.com/info/Operand) – "[infixed](https://infogalactic.com/info/Infix) operators" – such as the [plus sign](https://infogalactic.com/info/Plus_sign) in "2 + 2".

### Usage

Infix notation is more difficult to [parse](https://infogalactic.com/info/Parsing) by computers than [prefix notation](https://infogalactic.com/info/Polish_notation) ( e.g. **+** 2 2 ) or [postfix notation](https://infogalactic.com/info/Reverse_Polish_notation) ( e.g. 2 2 **+** ). However many [programming languages](https://infogalactic.com/info/Programming_language) use it due to its familiarity. It is more used in arithmetic, e.g. 2+2, 5×6.
