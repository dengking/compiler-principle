# compiler-principle
Compilers Principles, Techniques and Tools Second Edition is really an amazing book, as mentioned in Chapter 1 Introduction  
> This book is is about how to design and implement compilers. We shall discover that a few basic ideas can be used to construct translators for a wide variety of languages and machines. Besides compilers, the principles and techniques for compiler design are applicable to so many other domains that they are likely to be reused many times in the career of a computer scientist. The study of compiler writing touches up on **programming languages**, **machine architecture**, **language theory**, **algorithms**, and **software engineering**.

As mentioned in the paragraph above, the study of compiler is an interdiscipline invoving **computer science**(**programming languages**, **machine architecture**, **algorithms**, and **software engineering**) and **language theory**, so the book may be hard to understand if lacking experience in programming, grasp of common data structure(especially [tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29) ) and algorithms(especially [recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))).

The **language theory** in the paragraph above mainly refers to the [formal language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language),  I have create a repository [Automata-and-formal-language](https://github.com/dengking/Automata-and-formal-language) to record my knowledge of [formal language theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_language) and [automata theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automata_theory). A basic understanding of these theories will help understand the book.

The data structure mentioned in the book can be found in my repository [data-structure](https://github.com/dengking/data-structure).

The algorithm mentioned in the book can be found in my repository [algorithm](https://github.com/dengking/algorithm).
